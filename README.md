# AI-Enhanced Service Platform

This is a fullâ€‘stack, productionâ€‘grade AI service platform built as a comprehensive portfolio project. It consists of:

- **Backend:**  
  A FastAPI application that provides:
  - **AI Endpoints:**  
    - `/api/generate` for text generation using GPTâ€‘2.
    - `/api/sentiment` for sentiment analysis.
  - **Authentication:**  
    JWTâ€‘based user registration and login endpoints under `/auth`.
  - **Productionâ€‘Ready Features:**  
    Asynchronous processing, robust logging, rate limiting middleware, and health checks.
  - **Containerization:**  
    Dockerfile and configuration for deployment with Gunicorn & Uvicorn.

- **Frontend:**  
  A creative React application built with Vite and Tailwind CSS that:
  - Provides a modern, responsive UI.
  - Offers pages for text generation, sentiment analysis, and authentication (login/register).
  - Integrates with the backend via Axios and environmentâ€‘based API configuration.

- **Deployment:**  
  A Docker Compose setup to orchestrate both the backend and frontend for easy local or cloud deployment.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine.

### Running Locally with Docker Compose

1. **Clone the Repository:**
